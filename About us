					<h2> About; <b> Us.</b></h2>
					<p><b>The Guild CN’s mission is to bring more effective and efficient Chinese manufacturing solutions to Western startups and deliver a win-win situation. By presenting you and your company directly to the Chinese accelerators and factories, you will have access to the first-hand information faster and cheaper!</b></p>
					<p> As quoted by Nick Vardy, Co-founder of PinPress, a Waterloo company enrolled in Hax accelerator in 2015 "We came here for mostly research and development of our product, things in China can be done faster and cheaper than in Western or European countries, things that take a week with a large minimum order might be done overnight for half the price for example”. </p>
