                           <p><b>The Guild CN’s mission is to bring more effective and efficient Chinese manufacturing solutions to Western startups and deliver a win-win situation. By presenting you and your company directly to the Chinese accelerators and factories, you will have access to the first-hand information faster and cheaper!</b></p>

                         <p> As quoted by Nick Vardy, Co-founder of PinPress, a Waterloo company enrolled in Hax accelerator in 2015 "We came here for mostly research and development of our product, things in China can be done faster and cheaper than in Western or European countries, things that take a week with a large minimum order might be done overnight for half the price for example”. </p>
				
				<p>After working in law and manufacturing for 10 years, I caught my startup bug in 2015 while attending an annual startup conference in Silicon Valley. During the past two years, you could see me supporting startup communities everywhere, from Startup Grind to Startup Toronto, from TechTO to SalesTO to Hackernest. I thrive on making Toronto, the Silicon Valley North.</p>

                                <p>However, after two years, I realized the startup ecosystem lacks love for hardware companies. It takes a long circle for a hardware company to build its first prototype, to cut the cost or to get the funding from investors. That’s the birth of The Guild CN!  I hold two law degrees from both Canada and China and speak four languages. During my professional life, I have lead business negotiations between Canada and Chinese manufacturing companies for 5 years. Why not benefit from my knowledge and global network with my fellow hardware startups and bring you to the centre of attention, “Silicon Valley of Hardware”? </p>

                                <p>The Guild CN is designed to be a fun trip, bringing the brightest Guilders together to explore a new country and new business opportunity. Who can say no to fun and new business, right? Limited seats available, see you in China! </p>
